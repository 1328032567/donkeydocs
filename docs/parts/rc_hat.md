![RC Hat for RaspberryPi](../assets/parts/rc_hat.jpg "The Donkey RC Hat for RaspberryPi")

If you started with a ready-to-run RC car, it probably came with a RC controller. Good news: you can use it with Donkeycar, both using the RC controller for manual driving and plugging in the car's servo and motor controller directly into the RaspberryPi without the need for a special motor/servo controller board. 

To do so, you can either wire up it up manually as shown in [this tutorial](/parts/rc) (which works, but has a lot of fiddly wires that can fall off) or do it neatly with the Donkeycar RC hat, which handles all the wiring for you, along with including an OLED screen and a fan. 

The Donkeycar RC hat can be purchased from the [Donkeycar Store](https://store.donkeycar.com/products/donkey-car-rc-hat)
